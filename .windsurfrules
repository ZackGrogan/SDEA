Data Retrieval:
- Implement modules to access SEC filings using the SEC EDGAR Full-Text Search API.
- Ensure all API requests include the necessary headers (e.g., `User-Agent`) and comply with SEC rate limits.
- Implement pagination handling to retrieve all relevant filings across multiple pages.
- Store retrieved filings in a structured format for efficient parsing.
- Define clear retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for handling transient network issues during retrieval.

Market Data Integration:
- Use `yfinance` or equivalent APIs to retrieve historical market data, including stock prices, market capitalization, share performance data, and dividend information.
- Handle API rate limits and terms of service compliance.
- Implement caching mechanisms to reduce redundant data requests and improve performance.
- Validate retrieved market data to ensure accuracy and completeness.

Data Parsing:
- Use `BeautifulSoup` and `lxml` for parsing different filing formats (HTML, XML, plain text).
- Implement robust error handling to manage inconsistencies and variations in filings.
- Define specific parsing logic for 13D, 13G, and their amendments (13D/A, 13G/A).
- Extract all required data points as specified in the bounty description.

Data Processing and Enrichment:
- Enrich extracted data with financial information such as stock prices, market capitalization, share price performance over specified intervals (+7, +30, +182, +365, +730 days), and dividends.
- Adjust share prices for stock splits and dividends to ensure accuracy.
- Map CUSIPs to stock symbols and company names using available datasets (e.g., SEC's `company_tickers.json`).
- Calculate market capitalization using stock prices and shares outstanding.

Threshold Exit Tracking:
- Track shareholders falling below the 5% ownership threshold by comparing sequential filings.
- Determine the absence of filings beyond certain dates as potential indicators of falling below the threshold.
- Include a marker or flag (e.g., "No longer â‰¥ 5%") in the dataset when a threshold exit is detected.

Data Storage:
- Utilize Pandas DataFrames for in-memory data manipulation.
- Consider using SQLite for persistent storage if necessary.
- Implement data validation checks before storing data to ensure data integrity.

Frontend Development (Flask and Bootstrap):
- Use Flask and Bootstrap to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- Focus on functionality over aesthetics.
- Implement clear navigation and user input forms for specifying search criteria (e.g., date ranges).
- Display retrieved and processed data in a clear and organized tabular format.

User Experience:
- Provide real-time feedback during data processing (e.g., progress bars, loading indicators).
- Ensure accessibility and mobile responsiveness.
- Implement client-side validation to prevent invalid user inputs.
- Provide user-friendly error messages and guidance in case of errors.

Documentation and Compliance:
- Document the methodology, data sources, and assumptions made during data processing.
- Ensure all activities comply with legal guidelines and data usage policies (including SEC's fair access policy).
- Provide clear instructions on how to use the application and interpret the results.

Performance Optimization:
- Optimize data retrieval and processing for efficiency.
- Implement asynchronous processing (e.g., using Celery) if necessary to prevent blocking.
- Minimize database queries and optimize data access patterns.

Error Handling and Validation:
- Implement comprehensive error handling and data validation throughout the application.
- Log errors for debugging purposes and provide user-friendly error messages.
- Implement input validation to prevent invalid data from being processed.
- Handle potential exceptions during data retrieval, parsing, and processing.
