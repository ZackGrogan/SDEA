Certainly! Let's focus on outlining a comprehensive plan to develop the application, emphasizing its functionality and how to implement it to meet the bounty guidelines precisely.

---

## **Project Overview**

The goal is to create an application that:

- **Retrieves and compiles detailed data** from the past 15 years of SEC Form 13G, 13D, and their amended versions (13G/A, 13D/A).
- **Extracts specific data points** from each filing as specified in the bounty.
- **Enriches the data** with additional financial information such as stock prices, market capitalization, share performance, and dividends.
- **Tracks shareholders** who fall below the 5% ownership threshold.
- **Presents the data** in a structured and accessible format.
- **Documents the methodology** used for data collection and processing.

## **Application Structure**

### **1. Backend Development (Flask)**

The backend will handle data retrieval, processing, and business logic.

#### **a. Data Retrieval Modules**

- **SEC Filings Retrieval**

  - **Functionality**: Access and download Form 13D, 13G, and their amendments from the SEC EDGAR database for the past 15 years.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Utilize the SEC EDGAR Full-Text Search API to query and retrieve filings.
    - Ensure compliance with SEC rate limits and include the required `User-Agent` header with requests.
    - Implement pagination handling to retrieve all relevant filings.
    - Extract and store filing metadata (e.g., accession numbers, filing dates, company CIKs).

- **Market Data Retrieval**

  - **Functionality**: Obtain historical stock prices, market capitalization, share performance data, and dividend information.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Use financial data libraries or APIs (e.g., `yfinance` for free data) to fetch required market data.
    - Fetch stock price on the filing date and adjusted prices for performance calculations.
    - Retrieve dividend and corporate action data for the holding periods.
    - Handle data rate limits and ensure compliance with the data providers' terms of service.

#### **b. Data Parsing and Processing**

- **Parsing SEC Filings**

  - **Functionality**: Extract necessary data points from each filing, such as total shares owned, beneficial owner names, and share count changes.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Develop parsers to handle different filing formats (HTML, XML, plain text).
    - Use parsing libraries (e.g., BeautifulSoup, lxml) to navigate the document structures.
    - Implement robust error handling to manage inconsistencies or variations in filings.

- **Data Enrichment**

  - **Functionality**: Enhance extracted data with additional financial information.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Map CUSIPs to stock symbols and company names using available datasets (e.g., SEC's `company_tickers.json`).
    - Calculate market capitalization using stock prices and shares outstanding.
    - Compute share price performance over specified intervals (+7, +30, +182, +365, +730 days).
    - Adjust share prices for stock splits and dividends to ensure accuracy.

- **Threshold Exit Tracking**

  - **Functionality**: Identify when shareholders fall below the 5% ownership threshold and indicate this in the data.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Compare sequential filings for each shareholder to detect changes in ownership percentages.
    - Determine the absence of filings beyond certain dates as potential indicators of falling below the threshold.
    - Include a marker or flag (e.g., "No longer â‰¥ 5%") in the dataset when a threshold exit is detected.

#### **c. Data Storage**

- **Functionality**: Store the processed data in a structured format for easy retrieval and display.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use data structures like Pandas DataFrames for in-memory data manipulation.
  - Optionally, implement a lightweight database (e.g., SQLite) if persistent storage is required.
  - Ensure data is organized and indexed appropriately for efficient access.

### **2. Frontend Development (Flask with Bootstrap)**

The frontend will provide a user interface for interacting with the application.

#### **a. User Interface Design**

- **Functionality**: Create a clean and user-friendly interface that allows users to initiate data processing and view results.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use Bootstrap templates to design responsive and accessible web pages.
  - Focus on essential components without heavy customization or styling.

#### **b. Core Pages and Features**

- **Home Page**

  - **Functionality**: Introduce the application and provide instructions.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Display a brief overview of the app's purpose.
    - Include navigation links to other sections.

- **Data Retrieval Page**

  - **Functionality**: Allow users to start the data fetching and processing operation.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Provide a button or form to trigger backend data processing functions.
    - Show progress indicators or messages to inform users of the process status.

- **Data Display Page**

  - **Functionality**: Present the compiled data in a readable format.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Use tables to display data, leveraging Bootstrap's table styles for clarity.
    - Allow users to sort or search within the data if feasible.
    - Include pagination for large datasets to improve performance.

- **Download Page**

  - **Functionality**: Enable users to download the compiled data.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Provide options to download data in formats like CSV or Excel.
    - Ensure that the download functionality interacts seamlessly with the backend data.

#### **c. Interaction with Backend**

- **Functionality**: Ensure smooth communication between the frontend and backend components.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use Flask's routing to handle HTTP requests and responses.
  - Implement form submissions or AJAX calls for initiating backend processes without full page reloads.
  - Provide feedback to the user for actions taken (e.g., success messages, error notifications).

## **Functionality Workflow**

1. **User Initiation**

   - The user accesses the application through the home page.
   - They navigate to the data retrieval section to start processing.

2. **Data Retrieval and Processing**

   - Upon initiation, the backend begins fetching SEC filings based on the predefined criteria.
   - Filings are downloaded, parsed, and relevant data is extracted.
   - Market data is retrieved and merged with the filing data.
   - Threshold exit tracking is performed to identify shareholders who have fallen below the 5% ownership mark.
